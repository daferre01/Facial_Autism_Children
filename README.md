# Binary Crossentropy: Autism Detection

## Overview

This project focuses on utilizing binary crossentropy to classify children's faces based on whether they have autism or not. The objective is to develop a model that can accurately predict autism status from facial images.

The project leverages binary crossentropy, a commonly used loss function for binary classification tasks, to train a deep learning model. By analyzing facial features and their correlation with autism, the model aims to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between autistic and non-autistic children.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle at the following link: [Binary Crossentropy Autism Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/code/daferre01/binary-crossentropy-autism-0-8acc?scriptVersionId=177280435). It contains facial images of children along with labels indicating whether they have autism or not. 

## Implementation

The project is implemented using Python and deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The steps involved in the implementation include:

1. Data preprocessing: Loading the dataset, resizing images, and normalizing pixel values.
2. Model architecture: Designing a deep learning architecture suitable for binary classification of facial images.
3. Training: Utilizing binary crossentropy as the loss function and optimizing model parameters through gradient descent.
4. Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance on a separate test set to measure accuracy and other relevant metrics.
